1. make folder on "~/" at home
$ sudo mkdir  ~/.aws

2. create files with name credentials
$ sudo vim ~/.aws/credentials
# add these line

[terraform]
aws_access_key_id = Amazon-access-id
aws_secret_access_key = Amazon-Secret-access-key

#save and exit

3. on terraform folder create a file with name variable.tf
$ vim variable.tf

#Add these line
variable "region" {

	default = "us-east-1"
}

variable "profile" {



}

# save and exit

4. On example.tf make some changes at provider section
$ vim example.tf

#change these line
provider "aws" {
	region = "${var.region}"
	profile = "${var.profile}"
}

5. Now we can test our file by this command

$ terraform plan

At the last you will see like this

"Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy."
